Dear Students,\
the starting day of our course is getting closer. As pointed out in WueStudy the topic will not be 'Linux and Perl'.
Rather, we will learn programming in Python (OK, first steps of ðŸ˜‰). The course will be completely online, as I want 
you to use your own computer to start programming. As we have only five days, I would hate it
if we loose precious time for installing the needed resources. Thus, I want everyone of you to have the
following installed and running on the computer you are gonne work with:

- **Python** Please install the latest release from here https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/
- **PyCharm** (The IDE we will be using) https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows Choose 'Community' Edition (for
the operating system you are working on)
- **EduTools** In Pycharm: File -> Setting -> Plugins -> Marketplace -> EduTools -> install
- **Introduction to Python** In PyCharm:  File -> Learn and Teach -> Browse Courses -> Marketplace -> Introduction to Python

In case you encounter any problems, Google it and find a solution. Arguably the most important skill I want to teach
you in this course is to find solutions for you programming problems by yourself. There are tons of YouTube
videos explaining every detail of the installation process. And, as you will see in the course, StackOverflow
is always there to help!

OK, and if you got completely stuck ðŸ˜‰ ask for help in the course forum.
And as a last note, we will start every day at 10:00. End is usualy between four and five, depending on when your brain starts melting.

Looking forward to our Python journey,\
Joerg Schultz
